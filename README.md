1. Star the repository
2. Watch the repository for any changes
3. Fork the repository
4. Clone your forked repository into your local machine 
5. Create a new topic branch using `studentId-studentName` format, For example: 610001-JohnSmith
6. Checkout your new branch
7. Add a new file with your name, example: `hello.js`
8. Commit the changes
9. Merge your `studentId-studentName` branch with the main branch
11. Push your changes to the remote repo
12. Create a new Pull Request to the upstream repo
